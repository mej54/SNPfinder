# Sprint 1

- What went well: We were able to come up with accurate user stories approved by our client. We also investigated databases to use and gained access to them. We also found an applet-form of the type of website we would like to create, which is a good model for the basic skeleton of our program. The applet form is outdated and does not provide the 3D structures of proteins, which verifies the need for our project. 
- What did not go well: Due to the fact that we were mostly exploring databases and websites, we were unable to begin actual coding for the project. 
- What can we do better next sprint: Begin coding!
- How can we do it better: Focus on a specific user story to begin parsing databases. 

## Future
- The user story we will focus on for the upcoming sprint is:
As a researcher, I want to create scripts in Python that can download and analyze missense mutations from online databases, such as the OMIM database, dbSNP database, and HGVbase database, to parse data more efficiently
- Kimi and Molly will both be working on this user story for this upcoming sprint.
- New Scrum Master: Kimi


# Sprint 2

- What went well: We were able to access the OMIM database and parse the multitude of data to retrieve information on mutations/disease by entering gene names via command-line. 
- What did not go well: Right now, we are relying on OMIM's database and network. Therefore, if their database goes down, we do not have a back-up. In the future, we will have to have a back-up local version that we can use in case their website is down. 
- What can we do better next sprint: Make the code more well-suited to user interactions through web applications rather than command-line.
- How can we do it better: Learn how to incorporate our python code into a web interface. 

## Future
- The user story we will focus on for the upcoming sprint is: As a researcher, I want to create scripts in Python that can use PDB API to find the closest structure of a given protein sequence so that this can be used in the visualization.
- Kimi and Molly will both be working on this user story for this upcoming sprint. 
- New Scrum Master: Molly


# Sprint 3

- What went well: We were able to create a python script that accesses the PDB database to retrieve a visualization of the requested protein/gene. We also learned how to embed a general visualization of a protein using 3Dmol in our own HTML file. 
- What did not go well: We cannot figure out how to connect out current python script to accept/return javascript input.
- What can we do better next sprint: We are going to focus on more online tutorials so that we can better understand how to connect javascript/PHP/python scripts. 
- How can we do it better: Take the time to learn the functionalities of the languages. 

## Future
- The user story we will focus on for the upcoming sprint is: As a researcher, I want to have a website to view the mapped mutation protein visualizations so that it is more easily accessible for me and other researchers. 
- Kimi and Molly will both be working on this user story for this upcoming sprint.
- New Scrum Master: Kimi


# Sprint 4

- What went well: We were able to create a webite that utilizes 3dmol to view a protein of interest.
- What did not go well: We cannot dynamically change the embedded 3dmol visualization to view different pdb files.
- What can we do better next sprint: We are going to read the API for 3dmol to figure out how we can dynamically change the visualization.
- How can we do it better: Do more reading.

## Future
- The user story we will focus on for the upcoming sprint is: 
- Kimi and Molly will both be working on this user story for this upcoming sprint.
- New Scrum Master: Molly


# Sprint 5

- What went well: We found a way around the dynamic programming by creating multiple html pages. We also have now visualizations for choosing different pdb files and for viewing the mutations/disease with the protein.
- What did not go well: Not being able to use the API and the visualization for the mutations is messy as of now. 
- What can we do better next sprint: We will work on the aesthetics of the website, and try to highlight the mutations on the protein dynamically. 
- How can we do it better: Look into using iFrame.
